## A platform that simulates a mental health consultation and self-reflection.

The goal is not therapy, not diagnosis, and definitely not saving the world.
The goal is to practice building a calm, structured UI for sensitive topics like stress, anxiety, and self-reflection.

Everything runs in the browser using mock data and localStorage.

**What this app does:**

- Lets users write about what’s bothering them in consultation-style threads

- Provides guided prompts to help users express thoughts more clearly

- Includes simple mental health check-ins (PHQ-9, GAD-7 style quizzes)

- Shows progress over time using basic charts

- Offers a small, curated resource library

- Always keeps a visible safety/help page

No real counseling. No real AI. No backend. This is a UX and structure exercise.

**Tech snapshot:**

- Frontend: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind  
- Backend: Node.js + Express  
- Databases: MongoDB + Postgres

**Project status:**

This is an early MVP built for learning and portfolio purposes.
Future versions may add backend services, authentication, and AI features.

Right now, the focus is simple, usable, and finished.
